If you want to use an isolated buildout environment while hacking on
``django-autofixture`` you can run the following commands from the project's
root directory::

    python bootstrap.py
    bin/buildout

Please run now the tests that are shipped with ``autofixture`` to see if
everything is well::

    bin/test

Happy hacking!
